          Of course, my name is Jason. I grew up in the great city of Fort
          Worth, Texas but currently reside in Houston, Texas because my job
          took me here. I hope to one day end up back in the DFW area or maybe,
          if I am lucky, Austin, Texas. I graduated from Texas A&M University
          with a BS in Chemistry and currently work for an oilfield third party
          laboratory. I enjoy maintaing a physical lifestyle filled with playing
          soccer, going to lift wieghts at the gym, and climbing in my off-time.
        </p>

          I first started coding in my off-time with inspiration from my friends
          who are web-developers. I then signed up for a Udemy course to learn
          more about JS and see if this is something that I would want to pursue
          more of. Turns out that I enjoyed the problem solving process and
          creativity that can come with developing projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am hoping for a career change out of my current field by gaining the
          knowledge and experience required to do so in this course. I know it
          will ge a tough few weeks but I am excited for the challenge!
