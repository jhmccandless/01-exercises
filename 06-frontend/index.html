      This exercise is about making lists
      <div>
        Here's what I like about lists:
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>
              They're useful for displaying lists of stuff That's about it I'm
              gunna put another list itmehere because doing things in threes is
              cool
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        When you make a list, do it in this order:
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <li>
              If it's not an ordered list, us the ul tag, otherwise us the ol
              tag
              <ul>
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside eachother</li>
                </ol>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Lines. So many lines.</h3>

      Here's a couple ways you can express yourself
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
          <li><em>If you want to sound interesting, try the italic tag</em></li>
          <li>
            <strong>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>You did it! you should be proud of yourself</div>
        <div>
          <strong><em>yOu DiD iT! yOu ShOuLd Be PrOuD oF yOuRsElF</em></strong>
        </div>
